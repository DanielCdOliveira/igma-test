# A customer registration API (Name, CPF, birth)

## Important:

Validate the CPF before recording the customer in the database

Endpoints

- [x] Endpoint to create customers (this endpoint should return a 422 if the cpf is invalid)

- [x] Endpoint to search customer by CPF

- [x] Endpoint to list all clients (using pagination)

CPF validation rules
The CPF can be passed in two formats:

999.999.999-00 (with mask)

99999999900 (numbers only)

To validate the CPF numbering, you can use the rules in the following link:

https://www.macoratti.net/alg_cpf.htm#:~:text=O

## Requirements

- Write the CPF validation algorithm manually (DO NOT use ready-made libs for this)

- Write your own CPF validation code (Do not copy from other source code)

- Send us a github repository with your source code

- Use a language that allows the use of object orientation such as Java, C#, Python, Javascript, etc.

- Choose your preferred database</h4>
